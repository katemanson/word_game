#Word game: JavaScript version

This was an individual, personal project from Christmas break 2016&ndash;17, which came in the middle of the immersive coding course at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/). I've made it into the [final project for the course](https://github.com/katemanson/word_game_React). 

This version uses HTML5's [Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) and JavaScript to implement the UI.
