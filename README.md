#Word game: vanilla JavaScript version

This was an individual, personal project from the Christmas break 2016--17, which came in the middle of the immersive coding course at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/). I've made it into the [final project for the course](https://github.com/katemanson/word_game_React).
